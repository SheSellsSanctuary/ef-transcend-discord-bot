**`Attack Teams:`**

(Teams 1-3 are strong vs tank/cc enemies but only weak vs enemies with stealth and/or flying heroes in their 1st slot (ie. Wind Walker, Wyvern, Naga, Pilot, etc), so use it with Elf Archer troops when attacking those enemies.)

(Team 4 is strong vs stealth and flying enemies but weak vs enemies with tank/cc heroes in their 1st slot (ie. Sword Dancer, Blade Master, Dark Elf, Frost Demon, Golem, etc), so use it with Infantry troops when attacking those enemies.)



**`Defense Teams:`**

Lower KLs need to use a stealth elf unit like Wind Walker (anti-ground, fast, stealth crystal sniper) to have a better chance in preventing the enemy from taking your flags.  It is only very weak against enemies who use stealth detecting units in their 1st slot, but can prevent much higher KL enemies from taking your flags if they don't use stealth detecting units in their 1st slot.

Pilot in the 2nd slot also helps block flying enemy units if you are attacked quickly twice in a row and you run out of elf archer troops from your 1st slot's elf hero.

3rd and 4th slot undead/orc heroes futher help block air or ground enemies and destroy their crystal.  There is some leeway here in terms of which undead and orc heroes you can use.  For undead, Dark Spirit (anti-air/ground, cc, splash damage, high dps), Abyss Mage (anti-air/ground, fast, splash damage, high dps), or Dark Elf (anti-ground, push-back cc, tank) are the best to use.  For orc, Blade Master (anti-ground, fast, splash damage, high dps, tank) Wyvern Rider (anti-air, stealth crystal sniper), or Frost Demon (anti-ground, push-back cc, tank) are best to use.
