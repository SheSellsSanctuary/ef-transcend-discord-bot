Hello! 

Welcome to the Transcend Guild Endless Frontier discord server! 

**What now?**

You can head over to `#introduce_yourself`and let us know a little about you! Typically people post their location, hours they play, experience with EF - whatever else you'd like!

*Want to chat to other players?*

We're a friendly bunch so head on over to `#general`!. 

*After some help?* 

Ask any questions you have in `#strategy`, someone is normally around to help. We've also got a bunch of guides, type `!commands` in `#bot-commands` for a full list.
